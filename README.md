## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the game.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily use the game.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find it easy to play again.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to play the game and it be obvious how to play.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are  rgb (0, 0, 255) Blue for the board tiles, rgb(255, 0, 0) Red for the title and when "O" is played in a tile the its border turns red and rgb (175, 175, 175) grey for the backgroung based on feedback about large areas of white on screen made for a poor user experience.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site
            correctly. Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settle in to their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were syntax errors in the project which have been resolved.

### Validation

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - 
    [Results](https://github.com/)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results]
    (https://github.com/)
-   [ValidateJavaScript]https://validatejavascript.com/ - [Results](https://github.com/)

-   Using the above mentioned validators the following error logs have been recorded and actioned upon.
    -   index.html error log
        -   <img src="./assets/images/HTML_Validate_1.PNG">

    -   index.html error log resolved
        -   <img src="./assets/images/HTML_Validate_2_Fixed.PNG">

### Performance

The sites performance was tested using Google Chrome Lighthouse to ensure it is responsive in desktop and mobile applications.

-   [Google Lighthouse Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en)

-   Using the above referrenced tools each page was tested in desktop and mobile versions 
    and the reocrds from the test are as follows.
    -   Main Page Desktop
    -   <img src="./assets/images/Lighthouse_1.PNG">
    -   <img src="./assets/images/Lighthouse_2.PNG">
    -   Main Page Mobile
    -   <img src="./assets/images/Lighthouse_Mobile.PNG">
   
    The overall performance is high due its simplistic nature.

### Further Testing

-   The Game was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox browsers and their mobile 
    equivalents.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung S20A.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
-   Friends who work in the programming industry were involved in debugging the code.

### Further Improvements

-   The game could be improved by adding more styling to the page to make it more visually interesting.
-   A high score count to keep track of multiple games using a database to store the scores.
-   Adding a simpe back ground may make it more visually appealing.
